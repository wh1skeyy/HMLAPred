The very high number of missing values in -2 through -5 suggests that most applicants reported only one ethnicity.

co-applicant_ethnicity-1 to co-applicant_ethnicity-5 (various very high missing counts): These are analogous to the applicant ethnicity variables but pertain to the co-applicant. The high missing values in -2 through -5 indicate that most applications likely have only one co-applicant or that the co-applicant reported only one ethnicity.
